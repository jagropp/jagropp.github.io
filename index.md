### About me
I am a PhD student in the Weizmann Institute of Science exploring methane biogeochemistry. In my research I apply theoretical tools to elucidate the relations between microbes that produce and consume methane and the isotopic signals that they leave behind.

<!-- In August 2022 I plan to join the University of California, Berkeley as a postdoctoral researcher for a collaborative project with [Dipti Nayak](https://www.dnayaklab.com){:target="_blank"} (Department of Molecular and Cell Biology) and Daniel Stolper (Department of Earth and Planetary Science). -->
