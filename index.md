### About me
I am currently an [EMBO Postdoctoral Fellow](https://www.embo.org/funding/fellowships-grants-and-career-support/postdoctoral-fellowships/){:target="_blank"}, working on a collaborative project between the groups of [Dipti Nayak](https://www.dnayaklab.com){:target="_blank"} (Department of Molecular and Cell Biology) and [Daniel Stolper](https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/daniel-stolper/){:target="_blank"} (Department of Earth and Planetary Science) at the University of California, Berkeley, since 2022. I study anaerobic microbes using molecular genetics, metabolic modeling, and high-resolution stable isotope analysis.

In my PhD I worked with [Itay Halevy](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/eserpages/Halevy/){:target="_blank"} at the Weizmann Institute of Science, where I developed theoretical tools to study methane biogeochemistry which elucidated the relations between microbes that produce and consume methane and the isotopic signals that they leave behind.
