### About me
I am a PhD student in the Weizmann Institute of Science exploring methane biogeochemistry. In my research I apply theoretical tools to elucidate the relations between microbes that produce and consume methane and the isotopic signals that they leave behind.

In August 2022 I will join the University of California, Berkeley as an [EMBO Postdoctoral Fellow](https://www.embo.org/funding/fellowships-grants-and-career-support/postdoctoral-fellowships/){:target="_blank"} for a collaborative project between [Dipti Nayak](https://www.dnayaklab.com){:target="_blank"} (Department of Molecular and Cell Biology) and [Daniel Stolper](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sIcsK_IAAAAJ&hl=iw&oi=ao){:target="_blank"} (Department of Earth and Planetary Science).
