#### Quantum chemical calculations of equilibrium isotopic effects
Differences in the zero-point energies of isotopically substituted molecules result in characteristic isotopic ratios under isotopic equilibrium. The isotopic equilibrium fractionation factors (EFFs) between two molecules are often complicated to measure experimentally, and various methods for calculation of these EFFs have been developed over the years. We have used different models of one of the most common methods, the Density Functional Theory (DFT), to calculate EFFs between large organic molecules. We validated our calculations for H, C, N, and O isotopes against available measured EFFs, and determined which DFT models are most accurate for these molecules.
